## Issues

Please describe the issue:

* the plugin version
* the OS and IDE version. Open your IDE and go to <kbd>Help</kbd>, <kbd>About</kbd>, then <kbd>Copy</kbd>
* the stacktrace, if any in the event log (in the bottom-right corner of your IDE)
* any useful information

## Feature requests

If you are not comfortable with Java development, you can ask me to support new icons. Please:

* provide SVG (with `height="16" width="16"` in the SVG tag, this is required by IntelliJ 2020.1.4) or 32x32 PNG (with
  transparency) icon(s)
* explain the conditions to apply the icon(s), like filename patterns

You can open an issue, or email me (jonathan.lermitage@gmail.com).

:warning: Feature requests with no icon or no explanations will be ignored.
