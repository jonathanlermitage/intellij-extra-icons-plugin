Tip: to support new icons, you will want to
edit [this file](https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/intellij-extra-icons-plugin/blob/ide203/src/main/java/lermitage/intellij/extra/icons/ExtraIconProvider.java#L24)
. All icons and selection rules are registered here. Icons are stored in `src/main/resources/extra-icons/`.  
Try the plugin in a standalone IDE with `./gradlew runIde`.
