# License FAQ

## How to get a perpetual license?

As explained on the JetBrains marketplace, 12 months of uninterrupted subscription payments qualify you for receiving a [perpetual fallback license](https://sales.jetbrains.com/hc/en-gb/articles/207240845-What-is-perpetual-fallback-license).

## I am a student or a teacher, can I get a license for free?

Sure! Please register with [https://jetbrains.com/student/](https://jetbrains.com/student/), then follow [these instructions](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/community-programs.html). If you are facing issues, please contact JetBrains support directly. Unfortunately, I can do nothing, this is on the JetBrains side.

Also, if you contributed to Extra Icons, please email me, or send a private message on Twitter (JLermitage): I have some coupons for free licenses for you.

## I am an OSS developer, can I get a license for free?

I'm sorry, but I noticed that many OSS accounts were totally fake. I mean, many people simply create (or duplicate) a project with a few lines of codes, then they ask for an OSS free license.  
As of 2022-11-14, I no longer offer licenses for OSS developers. Instead, I donate to some open source projects (~1000 USD this year).

## I received a coupon for a free license, how does it work?

Please note a coupon is not an activation code, it's a bit weird. You need to hit the "Buy" button (monthly or yearly subscription, it doesn't matter), then enter the coupon code. The form will now say you will get a 9-months license at no cost.  
You can activate your coupons when you want, they have no expiration date.

## Will we have to pay for your [other plugins](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/author/ed9cc7eb-74f5-46c1-b0df-67162fe1a1c5)?

I have no plan for that. I now have supporters thx to the Extra Icons project, and I am super happy with that. I don't provide OSS to make money, I already have a good job.

## Why a paid plugin?

The funding of OSS is a big question and, unfortunately, I think we can't discuss this on the Internet. I tried, but had to deal with the extreme aggressiveness of some toxic users. It was a very disturbing experience. Some people have no inhibition on the Internet. I think they are a minority, but they are very loud. Additionally, some idiots organized a review-bombing against my 7 plugins (JetBrains moderators took some time to delete those toxic reviews, thx for their help).

To answer the question quickly, I am doing free and OSS since ~2010. I started on Sourceforge.net with some Java libraries and NetBeans plugins. Like many contributors, I am doing this for fun, to share and learn interesting things. Also, like many contributors, motivation varies over time, and I tried many things (including donations and sponsorship) but it simply doesn't work. Now, I am looking for a minimal recognition. Some people don't need this, but this is their own mentality, their own vision of OSS, and I think we should respect each other. That's why I am now asking for a modest financial contribution. Technically, I had to pick one of my projects, I think the most useful, and one of the projects that represents the highest number of work hours. That's why I don't (and won't) ask for a financial contribution for my other OSS projects. I now have supporters, and I am super happy with that. I want to work with supporters, not for customers.
